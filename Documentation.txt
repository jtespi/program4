---------------------------------------

Changed scale() in Circle.java to correctly change the radius.
Before it incorrectly added the factor to the old radius instead of multiplying it.

Super function call in Circle2.java had arguments in the wrong order.
The incorrect order was super( y, x, radius), which would reverse x and y coordinates.

The scale function used to allow negative scalars which would result in radius values being negative.
Fixed to not change the radius if the scalar is less than 0.

Intersects in Circle2 did not fully or correctly use the distance formula, so this was fixed.
Now, it calculates the distance between the two circle centres and compares it with the sum of the radii.
