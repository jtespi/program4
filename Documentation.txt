---------------------------------------

Changed scale() in Circle.java to correctly change the radius.
Before it incorrectly added the factor to the old radius instead of multiplying it.

Super function call in Circle2.java had arguments in the wrong order.
The incorrect order was super( y, x, radius), which would reverse x and y coordinates.
